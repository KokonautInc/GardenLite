# Kokonaut Garden Lite

Kokonaut Garden Lite was our first Product and used Open Source Technologies to help Growers Monitor their Crop. We are currently on our Second Generation Sensor, Kokonaut Mizu. This gives us the opportunity to Open Source the Garden Lite. This Repo includes the PCB, BOM, Enclosure Design, and Arduino Firmware. With this collection, you will be able to build your own WiFi Environmental Sensor.
