# Kokonaut Garden Lite

Kokonaut Garden Lite is our first Product and uses Open Source Technologies to help Growers Monitor their Crop.

We are currently on our Second Generation Sensor, Kokonaut Mizu. This allows us to Open Source the Garden Lite so anyone can create and learn how to develop their own Internet Connected Environmental Sensor.

This Repo includes the PCB, BOM, Enclosure Design, and Arduino Firmware. The Arduino Firmware is a work in progress and more updates will follow.
