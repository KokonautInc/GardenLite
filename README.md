# Kokonaut Garden Lite

Kokonaut Garden Lite was our first Product and used Open Source Technologies to help Growers Monitor their Crop.

We are currently on the Second Generation Sensor, Kokonaut Mizu, so now the Garden Lite has been Open Sourced 

# Included are

- The Enclosure STLs which you can 3D Print to enclose the PCB
- The PCB Gerbers. We used JLCPCB.com to produce the PCB's
- The BOM file. You will need to solder the parts yourself
- The Arduino Firmware is a work in progress and more updates will follow.

With this, anyone can create and learn how to develop their own Internet Connected Environmental Sensor in their very own compact enclosure.
